# Flusshygiene radolan recent to s3

Node.js task for pulling radolan data from the DWD FTP servers and storing them on AWS S3. Part of the Flusshygiene project. Can run on a EC2 and shuts itself down when done. Needs IAM permissions for S3 and EC2.

In production it should run as a timed AWS Fargate task.

## Usage

Setup:

Rename `example.env` to `.env` (`mv example.env .env`)  or create a new one (`touch .env`) and fill in your credentials for:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=xxxxxx-bucket
FTP_HOST=ftp-cdc.dwd.de
FTP_PORT=21
```

The settings for the FTP_PORT and FTP_HOST can stay as is.

```bash
docker pull technologiestiftung/flusshygiene-radolan-recent
docker run --env-file $(pwd)/.env --name radolan-recent technologiestiftung/flusshygiene-radolan-recent

docker run --env-file "$PWD/.env" --name radolan-recent technologiestiftung/flusshygiene-radolan-recent
```

## Development

```bash
cd path/to/folder/
